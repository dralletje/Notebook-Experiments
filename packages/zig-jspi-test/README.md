(The app works fully locally, so there is no difference between the hosted version or running it locally)

## Features

- ### Colorful!! ðŸŒˆ
- ### Compiles lezer grammar on the fly
- ### Runs custom javascript necessary for your grammar
- ### Explore your syntax tree to debug and style it
- ### Does not _completely_ break when grammar results in infinite loop!
  (You will have to refresh the page though ðŸ™ƒ)

## Usage

Can only be installed with yarn, because I heavily use workspaces..

```
yarn install
```

Now you know the drill:

```
yarn start
```
